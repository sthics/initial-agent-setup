# 💼 Agentic AI Fund Search Assignment (FastAPI + LangGraph)

## 📌 Objective

Build a **production-grade**, **scalable FastAPI application** that integrates an **agentic AI system** using **LangGraph**, enabling intelligent search, summarization, and reasoning over mutual fund data from [MFAPI.in](https://www.mfapi.in/).

---

## 💡 Key Goals

- Build an **Agentic AI workflow** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
- Use **mfapi.in** to retrieve real-time mutual fund data
- Enable users to ask questions like:
  - “Which large cap mutual funds performed best in the last 1 year?”
  - “Summarize HDFC Top 100 performance”
  - “Compare Axis Bluechip with ICICI Bluechip”
- Expose REST endpoints for triggering agent interactions using **FastAPI**
- Use **OpenAI (or mock)** for LLM-powered answers
- Ensure **testability**, **extensibility**, and **scalable structure**

## ✅ Requirements

### 1. Fund Data Service
- Connect with [mfapi.in](https://www.mfapi.in/)
- Implement:
  - `get_fund_details(scheme_code)`
  - `search_funds_by_name(query: str)`
  - `compare_funds(scheme_codes: List[str])`

### 2. LangGraph Agent
- Create agentic workflow with:
  - `FundSearcher` Search into funds API
  - `Summarizer` Sumarize the final output or structure it
  - `Comparator` Basic Comparision in between funds
  - `QuestionRouter` Follow up question in case of information is not available

### 3. API Endpoints
Expose the following endpoints:
```
GET /funds/search?q=bluechip 
GET /funds/{scheme_code}
POST /funds/compare
POST /ai/query
```

### 4. AI Questioning
Use OpenAI to:
- Summarize fund performance
- Answer natural language questions via `/ai/query`

### 5. Testing
- Unit test services, LangGraph agent logic
- Use FastAPI's test client

---

## 🧠 Example Prompt

POST `/ai/query`:

```json
{
  "question": "Compare SBI Bluechip with ICICI Bluechip fund"
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "summary": "SBI Bluechip has performed better over 3 years, while ICICI has had steadier NAV returns..."
}
```

Bonus Features
- Use StreamingResponse for AI answers
